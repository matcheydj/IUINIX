# IUINIX
Integrated Userland Idempotent Networked Information eXchange

Every file is a separate user.
The user's password is that username backwards.
Each user, including integrated binaries, kernels and libraries, should adhere to the ideal of idempotence in a mathematic, literal and computational way.
The entire and complete exchange, 'IUINIX', should function as an operating system.
It is not yet (2021.7.21) clear what this operating system is designed to do, but it should be able to perform basic group tasks in a containerized environment, either virtual or residing in structures already proven to function, notably those that function without causing damage or harm, on standard hardware.
